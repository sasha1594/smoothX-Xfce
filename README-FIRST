SmoothX-Beta2
---------------


Thankyou for Downloading this Icon theme.

This icon theme was created for XFCE but it may run on other desktops too.

Please extract the contents to your home folder typicaly ~/.icons/
if you have previous version Beta1 please delete complete folder and install fresh copy 
of smoothX-Xfce-RC1.

then dont forget to run icon-cache.sh file in a terminal or double click on the file.

sh icon-cache.sh

which generates cache files for each directory and helps applications load icons 
fast and your applications will be more responsive.

Later you will be able to switch icons from Menu/Settings-Manager/Appearance/Icons

I have included orb.png buttons for menu, right click on your menu/properties/ and select from there
to use rectangle button you should untick the -Show button title -check box.

Thats it.
Any doubts or complaints please post it on xfce-look.org
